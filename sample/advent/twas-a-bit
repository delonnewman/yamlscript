  'Twas a bit before $W(:holiday), and all through the $W(:place),
  not a creature was stirring, not even a $W(:animal).
  The stockings were hung by the $W(:hang-by) with care,
  In hopes that St. $W(:saint) soon would be there.
  The $W(:children) were nestled all snug in their $W(:beds),
  While visions of $W(:adj)-$W(:candies) danced in their heads.
  And $W(:relative) in their 'kerchief, and I in my $W(:hat),
  Had just settled down for a long winter's $W(:activity).
  When out on the $W(:outside) there arose such a clatter,
  I sprang from my $W(:seat) to see what was the matter.
  Away to the window, I flew like a $W(:flyer),
  Tore open the $W(:covers) and threw up the $W(:cover).
  The $W(:luminary) on the breast of the new-fallen $W(:fallers),
  Gave the lustre of mid-day to $W(:outers) below.
  When what to my wondering eyes should $W(:arrive)?
  But a miniature $W(:vehicle), and eight tiny $W(:service-animals).
